### SRE Challenge - Part 3
 
Now it's time to expose an HTTP API that, given a country ISO code and a date, returns the amount of requests handled by that location on that given day.

Input:
* Country ISO Code
* Date

Expected output:

```
{
    country: 'FRA',
    date: '2019-08-26',
    count: 1234
}
```

The API path is up to you.

You're almost there! The Part 4 is waiting for you.
